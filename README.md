* This project is to detect vietnamese sign languages alphabet, I have dectected some letters: a b c d đ e g i k l in Vietnamese.  
* This project will continue with some letters with 2 or more motions like â, ă, ê,etc. These are more difficult.
* I have collected images from my laptop camera with 10 classes, the data and model version 0 is to predict 3 letters: a,c,d. After the model works well, I have expanded the data to 10 classes.
* In the future, I will do all the vietnamese alphabet and some diacritics.
